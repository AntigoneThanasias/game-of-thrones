<h1>Welcome to the Game of Thrones</h1>
<p><em><strong>Game of Thrones</strong></em> is an American fantasy television series produced by the <a href="http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/HBO" title="HBO">HBO</a> cable network. It is based on the novel series <em><a href="http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire" title="A Song of Ice and Fire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></em>, written by <a href="http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/George_R.R._Martin" title="George R.R. Martin">George R.R. Martin</a> who serves as a producer, creative consultant and scriptwriter on the television series. <a href="http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/David_Benioff" title="David Benioff">David Benioff</a> and <a href="http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/D.B._Weiss" title="D.B. Weiss">D.B. Weiss</a> created the television series and serve as executive producers, showrunners and the main writers.</p>
<p>To date, the series consists of five transmitted seasons comprising fifty episodes in total. A further season is in production, and showrunners Benioff and Weiss have stated that going for eight seasons is the ultimate goal.<a href="http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Game_of_Thrones#cite_note-0">[1]</a></p>
<p>Production of the series is based in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belfast" title="wikipedia:Belfast">Belfast</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland" title="wikipedia:Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>, mainly at the Paint Hall Studios. It is the largest and most expensive television production ever mounted in Northern Ireland. Filming for the series has also been conducted in<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malta" title="wikipedia:Malta">Malta</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland" title="wikipedia:Iceland">Iceland</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia" title="wikipedia:Croatia">Croatia</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco" title="wikipedia:Morocco">Morocco</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain" title="wikipedia:Spain">Spain</a>, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="wikipedia:United States">USA</a>.</p>
<p>David Benioff was sent a collection of the first four novels in the series (<em>A Game of Thrones</em>, <em>A Clash of Kings</em>, <em>A Storm of Swords</em> and <em>A Feast for Crows</em>) by George R.R. Martin's agent. Initially sceptical of the fantasy genre, Benioff became a big fan of the books and invited his friend D.B. Weiss to develop the project with him for a screen adaptation. They initially considered a movie adaption, but realized this would mean losing most of the plot and characters from the books. Instead, they began working on an adaptation for television. They met with George R.R. Martin and spent several hours discussing the project. Martin was impressed with their enthusiasm and that they had already worked out the resolutions to several key mysteries in the books. He agreed with them that the series was a good fit for the cable company HBO, which Martin was already a big fan of.</p>
<p>HBO agreed to option the project in 2007 and active development of a pilot script began. However, this was delayed by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007%E2%80%932008_Writers_Guild_of_America_strike" title="wikipedia:2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike">2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike</a>. In October 2008 HBO exercised its option to buy the rights to the series and ordered a pilot episode a few weeks later. Casting announcements were made throughout 2009, with <a href="http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Peter_Dinklage" title="Peter Dinklage">Peter Dinklage</a> the first actor formally announced for the series. The pilot episode was filmed in Northern Ireland and Morocco in October and November 2009.</p>
