<h1>Doran Martell</h1>
<p>Doran Martell is the <a href="http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Prince_of_Dorne" title="Prince of Dorne">Prince of Dorne</a> and the Lord of <a href="http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Sunspear" title="Sunspear">Sunspear</a>. He is the head of<a href="http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/House_Martell" title="House Martell">House Martell</a>, the ruling house of <a href="http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Dorne" title="Dorne">Dorne</a>, and the older brother of the late Princess <a href="http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Elia_Martell" title="Elia Martell">Elia</a>, who was murdered by Ser <a href="http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Gregor_Clegane" title="Gregor Clegane">Gregor Clegane</a> in the <a href="http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Sack_of_King%27s_Landing" title="Sack of King's Landing">Sack of King's Landing</a>, and Prince <a href="http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Oberyn_Martell" title="Oberyn Martell">Oberyn</a>, known as The Red Viper, also killed by Clegane.</p>
<p>He suffers from a severe case of gout, which mostly prevents him from walking and restricts him to a wheelchair.<a href="http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Doran_Martell#cite_note-0">[1]</a></p>
<p>Unlike his more hotheaded and aggressive brother, Oberyn, Doran is a pensive, calculating, and patient man who always waits and observes before making his next move. Despite their different personalities, the two brothers were very close. While Oberyn could indulge in the wayward Dornish ways, challenging whomever he liked regardless of the consequences, Doran was raised to be more responsible as the heir to the Dornish throne. He truly cares for both his people and his family, and would never make a decision that would go against their interests. However, this is often against their wishes.</p>
<p>Doran has also been a witness to war and was deeply marked by its consequences. As such, he often tries to find a solution that avoids waging war, even if the honor of House Martell has been offended. This, along with his physical weakness, gives some people the impression that he is weak-willed and can be easily dominated, but this is misleading; Doran is just as ruthless and decisive as any other member of House Martell. He's simply better at hiding it - until the moment that he strikes. <a href="http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Doran_Martell#cite_note-1">[2]</a></p>
